# Markov Models

These are real simple and intuitive, completely dependent on probabilities.

## Markov Property

P(weather(today)|weather(all previous days)) = P(weather(today)|weather(yesterday))

Terminology
When the current state P(s(t)|s(t-1)) is only dependent on the previous state, it is known as First Order Markov
When the current state P(s(t)|s(t-1),s(t-2)), is dependent on previous 2 states, it is known as Second Order Markov
When the current state P(s(t)|s(t-1),s(t-2),s(t-3)), is dependent on previous 3 states, it is known as Third Order Markov

Lets start with a simple example
Sick or Healthy

. Model state of healthy vs having the cold or flu
Very much like real life problem
Take some data, build a max likelihood model
Study properties that emerge from model
make predictions from model
generate next most likely state

Lets assume :
p(sick|healthy) - 0.005
p(healthy|healthy) - 0.995
p(sick|sick) - 0.8
p(healthy|sick) - 0.2

So, p(healthy 10 days in a row|healthy at t=0) = A^(t-1) = 0.995^9 = 95.6%
So, p(healthy 100 days in a row|healthy at t=0) = A^(t-1) = 0.995^99 = 60.9%
Lets caclulate, 
p(sick 10 days in a row|sick at t=0) = A^(t-1) = 0.8^9 = 13.4%
p(sick 5 days, then healthy 5 days|sick at t=0)= p(sick 5 days|sick at t=0) * p(healthy 5 days | sick at t=0)
0.8^4 * 0.2*0.995^4 = 8% 
p(alternate sick and healthy for 10 days | sick at t=0)
SHSHSHSHSH = 0.2*0.005*0.2*0.005.... = 2e-13

A Harder Problem -
Expected number of days staying in the same state ? (e.g How many days would a person be sick given the model)
Infinite sums
p(s(t)=i|s(t-1)=i) = A(i,i)

SEO and Bounce Rate Optimization -
We want to increase conversions, increase traffic, avoid high bounce rate.

    First -
        How do poeple arrive at my page ? Home page ? Landing Page ?
        This is just pi (the intial state distribution)
        So once we have the markov model, then the pi, the initial state distribution will tell us that which pages the users are most likely to start on.
    Sequence of Pages -
        Landing Page -  buy button  - checkout - close browser
        Check probability to confirm validity of the sequences.
        Longer Sequence == more multiplication == smaller number
        
    Second Alternative -
        Compare 2 sequences log probability - then actual value of probability doesnt matter
        Consider just the state transitions (once I've added to the cart, what's the probability of checking out ?)
